So to make a long story short,I started body building in 2017. I was obese and I was not pleased with how i looked, it was hard for me to everyday things.It was cute to be a chubby kid, but as I got older and I would get made fun of for being bigger than the ideal slim 12 year old.Going to the store to get clothes was such a depressing time because my mom and I struggled to find a size that could fit me. Eventually I accepted me for myself, but I still wanted to be strong. A couple months later, a gym opened up near my house and ever since I have been going to that gym. Moral of the story: love yourself and don't let anyone put you down.
